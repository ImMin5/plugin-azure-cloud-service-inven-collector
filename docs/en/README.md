## Overview

To register an Azure service account in Cloudforet, you need the four settings information below.

- **Subscription ID**
- **Tenant ID**
- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**


>ðŸ’¡ Before starting the setup guide, please make sure **Subscription ID** has been created.
See the Azure Subcription Guides [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/initial-subscriptions)

This setup guide will take a closer look at what the above-mentioned information means and where to obtain it.

<br>

### Subscription ID

Azure manages costs and resources in units of objects called subscriptions.
The **unique identifier** that distinguishes this is **Subscription ID**.
See the Subscription [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/intro/azure-developer-billing#what-is-an-azure-subscription)

<br>

### Tenant ID

**Tenant ID** is a **unique identifier** for your organization provided by Azure Active Directory (AD).
Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management service that you use to manage users on an organizational basis.
See the Azure AD [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis)

<br>

### Client ID

**Client ID** is the Application ID issued when creating an Azure app.
You use Azure App to manage credentials and IAM users for your applications.
See the Azure App [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

<br>

### Client Secret

This is the **Client Secret** key that can be obtained through Azure App registration.
Required when using Azure's API and issuing tokens to access resources.

<br>

We briefly discussed the concept of setup information required when registering a Cloudforet Azure service account.
Now, let's learn more about **how to actually obtain configuration information** in the next lesson.

<br>

## Overall Flow

Cloudforet supports the **[azure_client_secret]** method through issuing authentication keys for integration with Azure.
The method using **[azure_client_secret]** requires the following setting information.

- **Subscription ID**
- **Tenant ID**
- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**

To obtain the above information, please proceed with the settings in the following order.

1. [App Registration](#1-App-Registration)
2. [Create resource group](#2-Resource-Group-Create)
3. [Grant Role](#3-Role-Grant)
4. [Authentication key generation](#4-Authentication key-generation)
5. [Confirm Subscription](#5-Subscription-Confirm)
6. [Service account registration](#6-Service-Account-Registration)
7. [Add custom role (select)] (#7-user-specified-role-add-select)

<br>
<br>

## 1-App-Registration

You can obtain **[Client ID]** settings information in Azure through app registration.
If there is already a registered app, it can be omitted.

(1) Log in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
(1-1) Enter â€˜app registrationâ€™ in the search box and click [App registration].

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-application(h2)-4.png" width="80%" height="80%">

<br>
<br>

## 2. Create a resource group

A resource group is a group for managing resources being used in Azure.
You can have a 1:N relationship with your subscription.
If you have created a resource group, skip this step.

(1) Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
(1-1) Enter â€˜resource groupâ€™ in the search box and click [Resource Group] in the service list.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-resource-group(h2)-1.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(2) Click the [Create] button.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-resource-group(h2)-2.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(3) After entering the project information, click the [Review + Create] button.
(3-1) Then click the [Create] button.

<br>
<br>

## 3. Assign roles

[Role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-definitions) is a collection of access permissions to Azure resources.
The Azure plugin requires a role setup with appropriate permissions to collect resource information.
> You can create a role with the required permissions by creating a custom role.<br>
> You can check how to create a custom role in [Course 7] (#7-User-Role-Assignment-Add-Select).

The collector plugin does not require any permissions other than read permission.
The permission information required for each plugin is as follows.

| Plugin                                   | URL |
|------------------------------------------| --- |
| Microsoft Azure Cloud Service Collector  | https://github.com/cloudforet-io/plugin-azure-inven-collector#authentication-overview |

The process of granting permission in Azure for the plugin to collect resources is as follows:

1. Assign roles to subscriptions
2. Grant roles to resource groups

(1) This is the process of assigning roles to subscriptions.
(1-1) Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
(1-2) Enter â€˜Subscriptionâ€™ in the search box and click [Subscription] in the service list.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-role(h2)-1.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(1-3) Click the subscription you want to grant a role to.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-role(h2)-2.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(1-4) Click the [Access Control (IAM) > Add > Add Role Assignment] button.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-role(h2)-3.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(1-5) Click the [Reader] role and then click the [Next] button.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-role(h2)-4.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(1-6) Click the [Select Member] button to select an application as a member.
(1-7) After adding members, click the [Select] button.
Click the Review + Assign button when it becomes active.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-role(h2)-5.png" width="80%" height="80%">

>ðŸ’¡ Please select the application with the corresponding icon.
> <img src="./GUIDE-img/create-role(h2)-icon.svg">

<br>

(2) This is the process of assigning roles to resource groups.
If you only want to collect resources from a specific resource group that belongs to your subscription, you must grant a role to that resource group.
If you have assigned a role to your subscription, you can skip this step.

(2-1) Log in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
(2-2) Enter â€˜resource groupâ€™ in the search box and click [Resource Group] in the service list.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-role(h2)-6.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(2-3) Click the resource group you want to grant permission to.
<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-role(h2)-7.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(2-4) Click the [Access Control (IAM) > Add > Add Role Assignment] button to start setting access permissions.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-role(h2)-8.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(2-5) Select the [Reader] permission and click the [Next] button.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-role(h2)-9.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(2-6) Select [User, Group, Service Principal] and then click [Select Members].
(2-7) Check [Selected members] and click the [Select] button.
The [Review + Assignment] button becomes activated and click it.


> ðŸ’¡ Selected members must have access to the selected resource group.

## 4. Generate authentication key

Authentication keys contain **credentials** information to access Azure resources.
You can obtain **[Client Secret]** setting information by creating an authentication key.

(1) Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
(1-1) Enter â€˜app registrationâ€™ in the search box and click [app registration] in the service list.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-key(h2)-1.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(2) Click the application for which you want to create an authentication key.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-key(h2)-2.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(3) Click the [Certificate & Secret > Client Secret] tab and then click the [New Client Secret] button.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-key(h2)-3.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(3-1) Enter the description information and click the [Add] button.

<img src="./GUIDE-img/create-key(h2)-4.png" width="80%" height="80%">

(3-2) Since you cannot see the generated password value again when moving the page, **note** the encryption key information.
The information in the [Value] column corresponds to the **[Client Secret]** setting information.

<br>
<br>

## 5. Check Subscription

This is the process of checking the **Subsciprtion ID**, which is the setup information required for the **[azure_client_secret]** method.
Cloudforet's user guide **does not include** the process of creating an Azure subscription.
For a guide to creating an Azure subscription, see [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/initial-subscriptions).

(1) Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
